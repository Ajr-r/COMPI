# TO FIND SUM TILL N
```C++
 int x=10;
    C<<x*(x+1)/2<<l
```
# LCM AND GCD
```C++
void solve(){
    int x=10,y=20;
    int m=max(x,y);
    while(1){
        if(m%x==0&&m%y==0){
            C<<m<<l
            break;
        }
        m++;
    }
    C<<__gcd(x,y);

# Balls and boxes
```C++
//if number of balls is equal to or greater than sum of n natural number then it can the boxes can have unique set of balls and with min 1 ball ber box and n is number of boxes
```
